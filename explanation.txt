Why Our Interpretation is More Efficiant: 


.global f 

factorial

bx lr r0 
we know we wanta multiply command (mul) 
know we wanna store all of that in r0 
take from r1 and r2 

mul r0, r1, r2

where is input number stored? 
first input parameter is inside register 0 

wanna have a loop 
	while (counter > 1)
	(counter should start at input value)
